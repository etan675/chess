Simple web based chess game, built with react js and tailwind css

key features/challenges:
- representing chess board data, using 2d array
- implementing rules for the pieces, including castling, logic required intricate array indexing due to needing to know where each piece is on the board
- drag and drop, mainly adding the nice UI indicators for each move, as well as manipulating react states in the different event handlers
- TODO: detecting checks, checkmates and preventing illegal moves
